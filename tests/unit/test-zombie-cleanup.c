/* Test the core decision logic for zombie cleanup
 * 
 * Mirrors the zombie cleanup logic in the statsupdate function in stratifier.c:
 * 1. If client->dropped is true
 * 2. Check if client exists in connector via connector_client_exists()
 * 3. If client doesn't exist in connector:
 *    - Check if ref == 1 (only our ref from iteration)
 *    - If ref == 1, remove from stratifier hashtable
 *    - If ref > 1, let others clean up when they release
 * 4. If client exists in connector:
 *    - Send drop message (legitimate drop)
 * 
 * This test validates the decision logic without requiring full ckpool initialization.
